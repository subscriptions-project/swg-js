This fork modernizes [gulp-eslint](https://github.com/adametry/gulp-eslint) to use the latest ESLint version, instead of an ESLint version from mid-2019.

This fork started with version `6.0.0` of [gulp-eslint](https://github.com/adametry/gulp-eslint).

If future versions of ESLint break existing APIs, then SwG engineers might need to manually update this fork.
