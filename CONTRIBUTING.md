## Reporting issues with __PROJECT__

### Bugs

If you find a bug in __PROJECT__, please [file a GitHub issue](https://github.com/__PROJECT__/issues/new).

The best bug reports provide a detailed description of the issue (including screenshots if possible), step-by-step instructions for predictably reproducing the issue, and possibly even a working example that demonstrates the issue.

### Suggestions and feature requests

The __PROJECT__ is meant to evolve with feedback.  The project and its users appreciate your thoughts on ways to improve the design or features.

To make a suggestion or feature request [file a GitHub issue](https://github.com/__PROJECT__/issues/new) describing your idea.

If you are suggesting a feature that you are intending to implement, please see the [Contributing features](#contributing-features) section below for next steps.

## Contributing code

The __PROJECT__ accepts and greatly appreciates code contributions!

### Tips for new open source contributors

If you are new to contributing to an open source project, Git/GitHub, etc. welcome!  We are glad you're interested in contributing to the __PROJECT__ and we want to help make your open source experience a success.

### How to contribute code

[DEVELOPING.md](contributing/DEVELOPING.md) has some more advanced instructions that may be necessary depending on the complexity of the changes you are making.

A few things to note:

* The __PROJECT__ Project follows the [fork & pull](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/#fork--pull) model for accepting contributions.
* Familiarize yourself with our [Design Principles](contributing/DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md).
* We follow [Google's JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html).  More generally make sure to follow the same comment and coding style as the rest of the project.
* Include tests when contributing code.  There are plenty of tests that you can use as examples.

## Contributor License Agreement

The __PROJECT__ hosted at GitHub requires all contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement in order to protect contributors and users in issues of intellectual property.

We recommend signing the CLA *before* you send a pull request to avoid problems, though this is not absolutely necessary until your code is ready to be merged in.

**Make sure that you sign the CLA with the same email address you associate with your commits (likely via the `user.email` Git config as described on GitHub's [Set up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) page).**

* If you are contributing code on your own behalf you can sign the ([individual CLA](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual) instantly online.
* If you are planning on contributing code on behalf of your company your company will need to agree to a [corporate CLA](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate) if it has not already done so.  Although this is a relatively straightforward process, it requires approval from an authorized signer at your company and a manual verification process, so to ensure you can get your code reviewed and merged quickly please start this process as soon as possible.
* If your company has already agreed to a corporate CLA you can indicate agreement to the CLA by having the appropriate person at your company add your email address added to the Google Group associated with your corporate CLA.

### Discussion channels

Technical issues, designs, etc. are discussed using several different channels:

- [GitHub issues](https://github.com/__PROJECT__/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/__PROJECT__/pulls)
- TODO: slack, groups
