# Extended Access

Extended Access is a feature that provides publishers with qualified leads to deepen user engagement and build brand loyalty. If the user engages with the publisher's content, Google might elect to offer them access to [Google News Showcase](https://support.google.com/news/publisher-center/answer/10018494) content instead of the publisher's paywall.
