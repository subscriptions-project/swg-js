# SwG Login Prompt flow

This is the flow in which Google will ask the user for permission to log them in to the publisher's site. It is initiated by the publisher when the publisher doesn't find a user's subscription but Google does find the subscription.


There are two ways to implement this flow:


1. Wait message (left), then notify the user they're being logged in (right), then let the user read.

2. Wait message (left), then prompt the user to log in (center), then notify the user they're being logged in (right), then let the user read.

The publisher is responsible for deciding which flow they prefer.


Here is an example of what the code for these flows can look like:

```js
// You, the Publisher, go to look up the user. Resolve the promise with an account (if it was found).
const  accountPromise = new Promise( â€¦ );

// We notify the user that their account is being looked up.
subscriptions.waitForSubscriptionLookup(accountPromise).then(account => {

    // Account was found.
    if(account) {

        // Option 1 - notify the user that they're being logged in with Google.
        subscriptions.showLoginNotification().then(() => {
            // Publisher shows content.
        }

        // Option 2 - get user permission to login with Google.
        subscriptions.showLoginPrompt().then(() => {

            // User clicked 'Yes'.
            // Notify the user that they're being logged in with Google.
            subscriptions.showLoginNotification().then(() => {
                // Publisher shows content.
            });

        }, reason => {

            // User clicked 'No'. Publisher can decide how to handle this situation.
            handleCancellation();

        });

  } else {

    // Account was not found. Let's create a new one.
    // Go to docs/deferred-account-flow.md for full documentation.
    subscriptions.completeDeferredAccountCreation({entitlements});

  }
});
```


The above methods coincide with the following views:

`waitForSubscriptionLookup(accountPromise)` - takes a Promise as input. The Promise is that you (the publisher) are looking up the account, and will resolve the Promise with the actual account.

<br/>

`loginNotification()` - returns a Promise. The View will time out after 2 seconds.

<br/>

`showLoginPrompt()` - returns a Promise that resolves when a user clicks "Yes". Otherwise, it will throw an error.
