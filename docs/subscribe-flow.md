# SwG Subscribe Flow

This flow shows the payment form, accepts payment, records subscription and updates the reader's entitlements. See [Subscriptions APIs](./core-apis.md).

*Important!* Please ensure you set up the `setOnSubscribeResponse` on any page where you accept purchases, not just before you call `subscribe` or `showOffers`. SwG client ensures it can recover subscriptions even when browsers unload pages.

First, please setup the subscription response callback via `setOnSubscribeResponse`:

```
subscriptions.setOnSubscribeResponse(function(subscriptionPromise) {
  subscriptionPromise.then(function(response) {
    // Handle subscription response.
  });
});
```

To activate subscription flow itself, call the `subscribe` method with the desired SKU:

```
subscriptions.subscribe(sku);
```

Another way to trigger the subscribe flow is by starting [Offers flow](./offers-flow.md).

The `setOnSubscribeResponse` callback will be called ince the subscription is complete, or when the previously executed subscription is recovered.

The response returned by the `setOnSubscribeResponse` callback is the [`SubscribeResponse`](./core-apis.md) object. It includes purchase details, as well as user data.
