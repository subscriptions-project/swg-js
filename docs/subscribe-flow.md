# SwG Subscribe Flow

This flow shows the payment form, accepts payment, records subscription and updates the reader's entitlements. See [Subscriptions APIs](./core-apis.md).

*Important!* Please ensure you set up the `setOnSubscribeResponse` on any page where you accept purchases, not just before you call `subscribe` or `showOffers`. SwG client ensures it can recover subscriptions even when browsers unload pages.

First, please setup the subscription response callback via `setOnSubscribeResponse`:

```
subscriptions.setOnSubscribeResponse(function(subscriptionPromise) {
  subscriptionPromise.then(function(response) {
    // 1. Handle subscription response.
    // 2. Once subscription is processed (account created):
    response.complete().then(function() {
      // 3. The subscription is fully processed.
    });
  });
});
```

Once you receive subscription response:
 1. You can process the subscription. For instance you can create a new account based on the `userData` info and save subscrpition for this account.
 2. Once subscription is processed, call `response.complete()`. This method will signal to SwG that your site has accepted the subscription. It will return a promise that will be resolved once the user has acknowledged subscription.
 3. Once the `response.complete()` promise is resolved, you can unblock content, show additional UI to the user or perform any actions you see fit.


To activate subscription flow itself, call the `subscribe` method with the desired SKU:

```
subscriptions.subscribe(sku);
```

Another way to trigger the subscribe flow is by starting [Offers flow](./offers-flow.md).

The `setOnSubscribeResponse` callback will be called once the subscription is complete, or when the previously executed subscription is recovered.

## Subscribe response
The response returned by the `setOnSubscribeResponse` callback is the [`SubscribeResponse`](../src/api/subscribe-response.js) object. It includes purchase details, as well as user data.
### Structure
The SubscriptionResponse object has the following structure:
```
{
  "raw": "",
  "purchaseData" : {
    "raw": "",
    "signature": "",
  },
  "userData": {
    "idToken" : "...",
    "data": { ... },
    "id": "",
    "email": "",
    "emailVerified": true,
    "name": "",
    "givenName": "",
    "familyName": "",
    "pictureUrl": ""
}
```
### `purchaseData` properties
| Name | Data type | Related In-app Billing purchase request field | Description |
| ---- | --------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| raw | String | [IN_APP_PURCHASE_DATA](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_reference#purchase-data-table) | A string in JSON format that contains details about the purchase order. |
| signature | String | [IN_APP_DATA_SIGNATURE](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_reference#purchase-pendingintent-response-table)  | String containing the signature of the purchase data that was signed with the private key of the developer. The data signature uses the RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 scheme. |

The `purchaseData.raw` fields are identical to the fields from an Android In-App Billing [IN_APP_PURCHASE_DATA](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_reference#purchase-data-table) object.
### `userData` properties
| Name | Data type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| idToken | String | The Google Sign-in ID Token. For more information, see [Google Sign-in for Websites - Authenticate with a Backend Server](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/backend-auth#calling-the-tokeninfo-endpoint). |
| data | Object | The information contained within the ID Token. |
| id | String | The user’s Google Sign-in ID. This corresponds to the sub field of the idToken. |
| email | String | The user’s email address. <blockquote><b>Note:</b> A Google account's email address can change, so don't use it to identify a user. Instead, use the account's ID, which you can get on the client with getBasicProfile().getId() , and on the backend from the sub claim of the ID token.</blockquote> |
| emailVerified | Boolean | Returns true if the email address is verified by Google. |
| name | String | Full name, including given and family name. |
| givenName | String | The user's first name. |
| familyName | String | The user's last name. |
| pictureUrl | String | The user's profile picture. |
