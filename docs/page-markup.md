# Subscriptions Page Markup

SwG requires configuring two main properties:
 1. The product ID that the user must be granted to view the content.
 2. Whether this content requires this product at this time.

SwG uses Schema.org markup. The JSON-LD and Microdata formats are supported.

## JSON-LD markup

Using JSON-LD, the markup would look like:

```
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "http://schema.org",
  "@type": "NewsArticle",
  "isAccessibleForFree": false,
  "publisher": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "The Norcal Tribune"
  },
  "hasPart": {...},
  "isPartOf": {
    "@type": ["CreativeWork", "Product"],
    "name" : "The Norcal Tribune",
    "productID": "norcal_tribune.com:basic"
  }
}
</script>
```

Thus, notice that:
 1. The product ID is "norcal_tribune.com:basic" (`"productID": "norcal_tribune.com:basic"`).
 2. This document is currently locked (`"isAccessibleForFree": false`)


## Microdata markup

Using Microdata, the markup could look like this:

```
<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/NewsArticle">
  <meta itemprop="isAccessibleForFree" content="false"/>
  <div itemprop="isPartOf" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/CreativeWork http://schema.org/Product">
    <meta itemprop="name" content="The Norcal Tribune"/>
    <meta itemprop="productID" content="norcal_tribune.com:basic"/>
  </div>
</div>
```

A usable configuration will provide `NewsArticle` typed item with `isAccessibleForFree` property and a
subitem of type `Product` that specifies the `productID`.

In this example:
 1. The product ID is "norcal_tribune.com:basic" (`"productID": "norcal_tribune.com:basic"`).
 2. This document is currently locked (`"isAccessibleForFree": false`)

The configuration is resolved as soon as `productID` and `isAccessibleForFree` are found. It is, therefore,
advised to place the configuration as high up in the DOM tree as possible.
