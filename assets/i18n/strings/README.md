# i18n strings

This directory contains (1) translation strings in XLB files and (2) a script that compiles them into a JavaScript file (`src/i18n/strings.js`) the Closure compiler can utilize.

You can (re)compile the `src/i18n/strings.js` file with the following shell command.
```bash
yarn build-i18n
```
