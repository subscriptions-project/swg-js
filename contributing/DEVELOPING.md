# Development on Subscribe with Google

## How to get started

Before you start developing in Subscribe with Google, check out these resources:

- [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) has details on various ways you can contribute to the Subscribe with Google.
  - If you're developing in Subscribe with Google, you should read the [Contributing code](../CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-code).

## Setup

Now that you have all of the files copied locally you can actually build the code and run a local server to try things out. We use Node.js, the Yarn package manager, Closure Compiler, and the Gulp build system to build `swg-js` and start up a local server that lets you try out your changes.

- Install the latest LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm). If you're on Mac or Linux, an easy way to install Node.js is with `nvm`: [here](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

  ```
  nvm install --lts
  ```

- If you have a global install of [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/), uninstall it. (Instructions [here](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/v3.9.1/docs/getting-started.md). See [this article](https://medium.com/gulpjs/gulp-sips-command-line-interface-e53411d4467) for why.)

  ```
  npx yarn global remove gulp
  ```

- In your local repository directory (e.g. `~/projects/swg-js`), install the packages that SWG uses by running
  ```
  npx yarn
  ```
  You should see a progress indicator and some messages scrolling by.

Now whenever you're ready to build `swg-js` and start up your local server, simply go to your local repository directory and run:

```
npx gulp
```

Running the `npx gulp` command will compile the code and start up a Node.js server listening on port 8000. Once you see a message like `Finished 'default'` you can access the local server in your browser at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

You can browse the [http://localhost:8000/examples](http://localhost:8000/examples) directory to see some demo pages for various SwG components and combination of components.

## Code quality and style

SwG uses [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) to ensure code quality and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to standardize code style. For easy development, here are two recommendations:

- Use a code editor with Eslint support to make sure that your code satisfies all of SwG's quality and style rules. [Here](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations#editors) is a list of editors with Eslint extension support.
- Set your editor to automatically fix Eslint errors in your code on save.

For example, if you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you can install its [Eslint plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint), and enable the `eslint.autoFixOnSave` setting.

Alternatively, you can manually fix lint errors in your code by running:

```
npx gulp lint --local_changes --fix
```

## DNS Aliases

For some local testing we refer to fake local URLs in order to simulate referencing third party URLs. This requires extra setup so your browser will know that these URLs actually point to your local server.

You can do this by adding this line to your hosts file (`/etc/hosts` on Mac or Linux, `%SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows):

```
127.0.0.1 pub.localhost sp.localhost
```

## Build & Test

Use the following Gulp commands:
